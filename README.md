# ETL_project
Developed and deployed a fully automated ETL pipeline to collect real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The pipeline extracted key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and pressure for a specific city, transformed the raw JSON response into a structured CSV format, and stored the final output in an AWS S3 bucket. The entire workflow was orchestrated using Apache Airflow, with tasks scheduled to run periodically and an HttpSensor used to check API availability before proceeding. The project was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, with IAM roles configured to securely manage access to S3 without hardcoded credentials. Emphasis was placed on modularity, error handling, and reusability, making the pipeline easy to maintain and extend for additional locations or data sources. This project demonstrates practical implementation of data engineering principles, including workflow automation, cloud integration, and reliable data ingestion for real-time use cases.
